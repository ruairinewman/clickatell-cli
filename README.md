# clickatell-cli
Simple Python-based Clickatell CLI

Syntax: $ ./sms.py "Destination Phone Number" "Text message, no greater than 160 characters"

Note: the destination phone number should omit the international dialling prefix but include the destination 
country code. For example, for an Irish phone number, locally 088-765-4321, the number specified would be 353887654321.
(353 is the internation dialling code for Ireland.)
